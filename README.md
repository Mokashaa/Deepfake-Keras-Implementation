# Deepfake-Keras-Implementation
implementing DCGAN or Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network, and training the network to generate realistic looking synthesized images
# This project consists of
## Task 1: Importing and Plotting the Data
    1. Importing the MNIST Dataset
    2. Creating a subset of the dataset for just one class.
    3. Visualizing the subset.
## Task 2: Discriminator
    1. Creating a Discriminator Network.
    2. Creating an optimizer instance.
## Task 3: Generator
    1. Creating a Generator Network.
    2. Generating a new image from the untrained Generator model.
## Task 4: Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
    1. Connecting the Generator and Discriminator to create a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
## Task 5: Training the GAN
    1. Creating a training loop.
    2. Creating a dynamic plot that displays generated images after each epoch.
## Task 7: Final Results
